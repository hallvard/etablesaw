# Viewing and plotting table data

There are several views for table data. The **Tablesaw viewer** provides the viewer features of the editor, e.g. supports filtering rows using expressions and hiding columns.

The table summary and crosstab views derive new tables from existing ones.

The plotting views supports various charts, e.g. bar and line charts. Each view includes controls for selecting the columns relevant for the chart. Some also support aggregating data.
